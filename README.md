# Single Cycle Processor

- The project assignment of CS 223 (Digital Design) course taken at Bilkent University in 2020-2021 Fall semester.
- This repository contains a simplified single-cycle processor that is capable of performing several types of instructions.
- The processor performs several functions depending on the 16- bit instructions on 8-bit data.
- The projet is implemented with System Verilog and tested on Vivado Basys3 FPGA board.
